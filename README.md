# 🚀 Week 1 - DEZoomcamp: Exploring DevOps & Cloud Technologies 

In the first week of DEZoomcamp, I covered:

🔹 **Docker**: Built and ran containers, worked with Docker networking, and interacted with Postgres SQL for data ingestion.

🔹 **GCP**: Learned about storage buckets, SDK, and authentication.

🔹 **Terraform**: Explored Infrastructure as Code (IaC), configured GCP resources, and used init, plan, apply, and destroy commands.

Excited for what’s ahead! 💻🌐
